			</section>
			<section class="instructions">
				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<h4>For the Filling</h4>
				<ol>
				<li>Place the ricotta in a fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth. Place the strainer over a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for 8 hours to remove excess moisture.</li>
					<li>In  a large bowl, whisk together the drained ricotta, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon until smooth.</li>
					<li>Gently fold mini chocolate chips into ricotta mixture.</li>
					<li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the filling to set.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>For the Shell</h4>
				<ol>
				<li>Prepare the dough: In a food processor or large bowl, pulse or whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, and salt. Add the cold butter and mix until pebbled.</li>
					<li>Mix the liquid ingredients: Add the Marsala wine and egg yolks (reserving  the eggs whites to seal). Pulse or mix with a mixer until the dough begins to come together.</li>
					<li>Knead and rest: Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 3-4 minutes until smooth. Form into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate fro 1 hour.</li>
					<li>Roll and cut: On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out as thin as possible (approximately 6mm). Use a 10mm diameter round cookie cutter to cut out circles.</li>
					<li>Fold the shell: Brush one side of the dough circle with the reserved egg white. Roll the rough, egg white side down, around a greased cannoli tube and press the moistened edge firmly to seal.</li>
					<li>Fry the shells: Add 1-2 inches of vegetable oil to heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat to 185&deg;C. Using tongs, carefully place a few shells into the hot oil and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown and blistered.</li>
					<li>Cool: Remove the fried shells and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Once cool enough to handle, gently slide the shells out of the cannoli tubes.</li>
